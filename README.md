# Classification model evaluation and report generation : 

# Steps of Implementation : 

## Step 1 : Import necessary libraries , onboard data and perform initial EDA analysis

## Step 2 : Feature engineering 

## Step 3 : Dataset generation

## Step 4 : Model building , comparing model performance on reference and current dataset and different model performance comparison . Some exaample visualizations are attached below
